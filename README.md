# data-structure-and-algorithms

in this repopsitory i will push my training about data structure and algorithms. training projects built by typescript, also i have tried to avoid using native methods and some features which is belong to typescript and javascript :)

# dynamic-array

in this file dynamic Array data structure implemented with typescript, altough typescript support this concept by default but i assumed that this is a totally new concept and i implemented that from scratch

# linked-list

in this file LinkedList data structure implemented with typescript, altough in typescript and js we don't have this concept but i implemented that and its various methods step by step

# stack
